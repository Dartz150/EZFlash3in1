# EZFlash3in1
Source code for all EZ-Flash3in1 models, with support for every existing flash chip models (v1,v2,v3).
With this, you can implement EZ-Flash3in1 support to your NDS homebrew projects. SRAM patching is not included, so you have to implement your own solution for proper saving support.

## **What is this for?**

The EZ-Flash3in1 is a slot 2 expansion pack originally made as a sidekick to the EZ-Flash V for use on the Nintendo DS Phat/lite. It's called 3in1 because it has GBA,
NDS RAM Expansion Pak, and NDS Rumble Pak Hardware Emulation Support.

It got support in other flashcards by implementing this into their Kernels.

## Flashcards that currently have *full* EZ-Flash3in1 support for their respective Kernels:

- Acekard 2i with AKAIO
- WOOD R4
- cycloDS iEvolution
- M3
- iEdge
- EZ Flash Vi
- iSmart Premuim

## Kernels that currently have *partial* EZ-Flash3in1 support (v1 only)
- Wood based Clones (Ace3DS+)
- WAIO
- YSMenu (SRAM Autopatch is not supported, needs to be made manually externally.)
